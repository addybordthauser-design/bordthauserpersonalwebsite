            <h2>Why UMD & Duluth</h2>
            <h3>Why I Chose University of Minnesota Duluth</h3>
            <p>
                I chose the University of Minnesota Duluth because of its strong marketing program, supportive community, and opportunities for hands-on learning. I was drawn to the balance it offers between academics and student life, as well as the chance to grow both personally and professionally in a close-knit environment.

            <h3>What I Like About Duluth and the Surrounding Area</h3>
            <p>
                I really enjoy living in Duluth and exploring the surrounding area. The city has a unique mix of small-town charm and natural beauty, from the scenic Lake Superior shoreline to the many trails and outdoor spaces perfect for running, hiking, or just enjoying nature. I also love the sense of community here, the local events, and the friendly atmosphere that makes Duluth feel like home.

            <h3>Personal Experiences and Campus Highlights (Involvement)</h3>
            <p>
                On campus, I’ve had the opportunity to get involved in several activities that reflect my interests and passions. I work as a fitness instructor, teaching Pilates classes and leading pop-up sessions, which allows me to combine my love for fitness with helping others stay active and healthy. I also serve on the executive board of the UMD GLOW Club as the Public Relations Coordinator, where I help promote events that support women’s wellness. Through GLOW, I also get the chance to teach Pilates about once a month, sharing my skills while encouraging others to prioritize their health. In addition, I’m involved in the Women in Business organization and the Run Club, which gives me the opportunity to connect with others who share my enthusiasm for fitness and personal growth. These experiences have helped me grow as a leader, strengthen my communication skills, and make meaningful contributions to the campus community.

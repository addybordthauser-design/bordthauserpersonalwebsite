                <h4>Why I’m Interested:</h4>
                <p>
                    I am interested in working at Maurices corporate as a Marketing Director because of my long-standing connection with the company and my passion for marketing. I worked at Maurices for three years, and that experience is what initially sparked my interest in marketing. While on the sales floor, I often participated in floor set design, merchandising, and visual presentation. I became fascinated with the strategic decisions behind why certain clothing is displayed together, how product placement affects customer experience, and how the marketing team shapes brand identity behind the scenes. Being part of the creative process that influences customer engagement is something I am eager to contribute to on a larger scale in a corporate marketing role.

                <h4>Why I’m Qualified / Skills Alignment:</h4>
                <p>
                    Having hands-on experience in merchandising, customer service, and visual presentation gives me a unique perspective on retail marketing. My marketing studies at UMD have strengthened my skills in social media management, content creation, and brand strategy. Combined with my creativity, attention to detail, and familiarity with Maurices’ brand, I am well-prepared to contribute to marketing campaigns, develop innovative promotions, and help drive the company’s brand vision forward.
